Cat is the script I use as a Rutgers iLab Assistant to troll students who have left themselves logged in at the end of the night. _The original artwork for cat comes from Khan, a troll Rutegrs iLab Assistant who came before me. I only improved it with my own script and by adding rainbows and sparkles._
